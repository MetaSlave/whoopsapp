Cryptographic Primitives in Double Ratchet Algorithm:
- Curve25519
- AES-CBC-256
- HMAC-SHA256

Double Ratchet Allows For:
- Regeneration of AES-256 Keys Any Time
- Generate New Keys with Previous Keys
- Forward and Backward Secrecy (Compromise of any keys does not mean compromise of other keys derived)
- Output of KDF(Key Derivation Function) is Input of Next KDF
- One Way Much like a Hash Function
