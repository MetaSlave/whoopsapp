Cryptographic Primitives in Double Ratchet Algorithm:
- Curve25519
- AES-CBC-256
- HMAC-SHA256

Double Ratchet Allows For:
- Regeneration of AES-256 Keys Any Time
- Generate New Keys with Previous Keys
- Forward and Backward Secrecy (Compromise of any keys does not mean compromise of other keys derived)
- Output of KDF(Key Derivation Function) is Input of Next KDF
- One Way Much like a Hash Function

Diffie Hellman Ratchet:


To Encrypt:
	1. KDF Key and Secret is put through KDF function, outputting 2 Output Keys
	2. One of the Output Keys is used for Encryption of Message, the other is used as Input Key for next KDF

To Decrypt:
